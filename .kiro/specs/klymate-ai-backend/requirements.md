# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Klymate AI Backend Development project aims to build a comprehensive, scalable FastAPI backend system for Klymate AI - a carbon footprint tracker with AI-powered coaching capabilities. This system will support user onboarding, habit tracking, AI-driven personalized coaching, gamification features, and analytics. The project focuses on creating a robust architecture with proper security, database design, AI integration, and deployment strategies to support a 4-week hackathon timeline.

3. WHEN code is ready for production THEN the dev branch SHALL be merged into main branch only after review and testing
4. WHEN any merge is requested THEN it SHALL require a pull request for all merges
5. WHEN a pull request is created THEN it SHALL include proper review and testing before approval

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want proper secret management and security practices, so that sensitive information like API keys and database credentials are never exposed in the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN it SHALL include a .env file for storing secrets
2. WHEN the .env file is created THEN it SHALL contain API keys and database credentials
3. WHEN the repository is configured THEN the .env file SHALL be included in .gitignore
4. WHEN the .gitignore is examined THEN it SHALL prevent .env files from being committed to version control
5. WHEN secrets are needed in the application THEN they SHALL be loaded from environment variables only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want a properly configured FastAPI application entry point, so that the backend server can be started and configured consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main.py file is created THEN it SHALL serve as the FastAPI application entry point
2. WHEN the FastAPI application is configured THEN it SHALL properly initialize the application instance
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables
4. WHEN the application is running THEN it SHALL be accessible via the configured host and port
5. WHEN the application structure is examined THEN it SHALL follow FastAPI best practices for organization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency management, so that all required Python packages are clearly defined and can be installed consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the requirements.txt file is created THEN it SHALL list all Python dependencies with specific versions
2. WHEN dependencies are added THEN they SHALL be documented in requirements.txt
3. WHEN the project is set up in a new environment THEN all dependencies SHALL be installable via pip install -r requirements.txt
4. WHEN FastAPI is included THEN it SHALL be specified with an appropriate version constraint
5. WHEN the requirements are examined THEN they SHALL include all necessary packages for the backend functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to complete an onboarding survey about my lifestyle, so that the system can calculate my baseline carbon footprint and set personalized goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL present an onboarding survey
2. WHEN the survey is presented THEN it SHALL collect data about transport habits, diet preferences, lifestyle choices, and business/farm activities
3. WHEN the survey is completed THEN the system SHALL calculate and store the user's baseline carbon footprint
4. WHEN the baseline is calculated THEN it SHALL be used for goal setting and progress tracking
5. WHEN the onboarding data is stored THEN it SHALL be persisted in the TiDB database

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with an AI coach that provides personalized carbon reduction tips, so that I can receive actionable advice based on my specific habits and goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests AI coaching THEN the system SHALL process the request through a separate AI service
2. WHEN AI processing occurs THEN it SHALL use LangChain to orchestrate OpenAI API calls
3. WHEN the AI generates responses THEN it SHALL track user inputs and run carbon footprint calculations
4. WHEN coaching tips are provided THEN they SHALL be actionable and personalized to the user's profile
5. WHEN AI conversations occur THEN the history and embeddings SHALL be stored in TiDB for context and learning
6. WHEN vector search is needed for AI functionality THEN TiDB SHALL be used for vector storage and retrieval operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to earn badges and participate in challenges, so that I stay motivated to reduce my carbon footprint through gamification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users achieve carbon footprint reductions THEN the system SHALL award appropriate badges and achievements
2. WHEN daily or weekly goals are set THEN the system SHALL track streaks and progress
3. WHEN users participate in challenges THEN their eco-scores SHALL be calculated and ranked
4. WHEN leaderboards are displayed THEN they SHALL show user rankings based on eco-scores for friendly competition
