# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Klymate AI Backend Development project aims to build a comprehensive, scalable FastAPI backend system for Klymate AI - a carbon footprint tracker with AI-powered coaching capabilities. This system will support user onboarding, habit tracking, AI-driven personalized coaching, gamification features, and analytics. The project focuses on creating a robust architecture with proper security, database design, AI integration, and deployment strategies to support a 4-week hackathon timeline.
